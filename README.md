# MySQLMiniAirbnb

A hands-on project to get a taste of MySQL in all its glory.

<h2>Features:</h2>

MiniAirbnb is a simple full-stack CRUD app using Node, Express, EJS, and MySQL. Users must register and authenticate before being able to interact with the site.
Registration is handled with bcrypt meaning that passwords stored in the MySQL database are salted and hashed. Once authenticated, users can view available lodgings, create new lodgings, and make reservations for lodgings that aren't their own. Likewise, users can delete their own reservations and lodgings.
